# Introduction

Simple Python script to create a Spotify playlist from a plain text file. It reads the lines from a given textfile and searches Spotify for each line and creates a playlist with the first result from every search. The text filename is used as the playlist name. 

This script requires a Spotify developer account to run. To create a developer account, head over to https://developer.spotify.com/ and follow instructions to create it.
